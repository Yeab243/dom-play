    <P> 
      <b> This is a webpage that helps the actors of "Captain Phillips" touch the name of the character they are 
      playing so it highlights their lines to make it easier to rehearse. 
      I created a small, single page application using the DOM. With a single click, it highlights 
      all lines for a specific actor in a play yellow and the rest grey. The does the work without page re-loads.
